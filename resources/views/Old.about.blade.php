        <p class="lead">Companions staff and trained volunteers bring into the jail or prison a selection of brand new books, along with audio recorders. They assist participating mothers in choosing an age-appropriate book for each of their children. Each of the mothers is then given an opportunity to record herself reading the books for her children. If she wishes, the mother may end with a message of love to the children and thanks to the caregiver. On behalf of the mother, Companions then sends the books and CDs to the children.</p>

          <h4>History</h4>
          <p>Aunt Maryâ€™s Storybook Project was started by Companions in 1993 as a Christmas project for the children of women incarcerated at Cook County Jail in Chicago. It has since become a year-round program and has served as a model for similar programs in over 20 states.</p>
